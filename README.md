Some shiny apps useful for teaching purposes

* CriticalValues: Calculate critical values (i.e. quantile) for the Normal, t, F, and Chi-square distributions. User supplies the parameters of the distribution and the required p-value, and the app shows the distribution and critical range(s).
* Distributions: Calculate the exceedence (or cumulative) probability for the Normal, t, F, and Chi-square distributions. User supplies the parameters of the distribution and the test value, and the app shows the distribution and region in the distribution for which the probability is calculated.
* NormalSampling: Draw samples of varying size from a Normal distribution and show as a histogram with the Normal population distrbution overlayed. New samples can be added to the existing sample, or new samples can be drawn.
